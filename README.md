## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- TensorFlow.js
- MobileNet Model
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Lucide React Icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-image-recognition.git
cd ai-image-recognition
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## How It Works

1. The application loads the MobileNet model using TensorFlow.js when the page loads
2. Users can either upload their own image or use the demo image
3. The AI model processes the image and returns predictions
4. Results are displayed showing the predicted objects and confidence levels
